# WhatsApp Scheduler Pro 🚀

A robust Windows desktop application to schedule WhatsApp messages with attachments using Python, PySide6, and Windows Task Scheduler.

 Why This Project?
Unlike other scripts that require the app to stay open, this tool integrates with the **Windows Task Scheduler API**. Once a task is scheduled, you can close the app or even restart your computer—Windows will handle the trigger.

 🛠 Tech Stack
- GUI: PySide6 (Qt)
- Automation: Undetected-Chromedriver (Bypasses bot detection)
- Database: SQLite
- OS Integration: Windows Task Scheduler (via `schtasks`)
